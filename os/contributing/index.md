## Contributing to RancherOS
---

### Developing

Development is easiest done with QEMU on Linux.  If you aren't running Linux natively then we recommend you run VMware Fusion/Workstation and enable VT-x support.  Then, QEMU (with KVM support) will run sufficiently fast inside a Linux VM.

First run `./build.sh` to create the initial bootstrap Docker images.  After that if you make changes to the go code only run `./scripts/build`.  To launch RancherOS in QEMU from your dev version, run `./scripts/run`.  You can SSH in using `ssh -l rancher -p 2222 localhost`.  Your SSH keys should have been populated so you won't need a password.  If you don't have SSH keys then the password is "rancher".

### Building

Docker 1.5+ required.

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

When the build is done, the ISO should be in `dist/artifacts`.

### Repositories

All of repositories are located within our main GitHub [page](https://github.com/rancher).
