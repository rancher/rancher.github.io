## ROS
---
_In v0.3.1+, we changed the command from `rancherctl` to `ros`._

A useful command that can be used with RancherOS is `ros` which can be used to control and configure the system. `ros` requires you to be the root user, so with the rancher user, you will need to use `sudo`.

### Sub Commands
---
| Command  | Description                                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
|`config`, `c`  |	[Configure Settings]({{site.baseurl}}/os/rancheros-tools/ros/config/)                       |
|`env`, `e`     | [Run a command with RancherOS environment]({{site.baseurl}}/os/rancheros-tools/ros/env/)      |
|`service`, `s`   |	[Service Settings]({{site.baseurl}}/os/rancheros-tools/ros/service/)                          |
|`os`           |   [Operating System Upgrade/Downgrade]({{site.baseurl}}/os/rancheros-tools/ros/os/)      |
|`tls`          |	[Setup TLS configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/os/rancheros-tools/ros/tls/)                 |
|`help`, `h`    |	Shows a list of commands or help for one command |


### RancherOS Version
---
If you want to check what version you are on, just use the `-v` option.

```sh
$ sudo ros -v
ros version v0.3.1
```

### Help
---
To list available commands, run any `ros` command with `-h` or `--help`. This would work with any subcommand within `ros`.

```sh
$ sudo ros -h
