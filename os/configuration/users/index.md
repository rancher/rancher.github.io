## Configuring RancherOS Users
---

Currently, we don't support adding other users besides `rancher`. 

You _can_ add users in the console container, but these users will only exist as long as the console container exists. It only makes sense to add users in a [persistent consoles]({{site.baseurl}}/os/configuration/custom-console/#console-persistence), e.g. ubuntu-console or debian-console.
