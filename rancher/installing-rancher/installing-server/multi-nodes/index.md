## Installing Rancher Server (HA)
---

As of the Beta release, Rancher server is capable of running in a HA configuration. We recognize that the setup is complex, and we will be working on making it easier to stand up as we approach GA. In the meantime, if you would like to experiment with Rancher running in HA, here is the basic outline.

### Pre-requisites

To launch a HA configuration Rancher needs the following:

*  Shared MySQL DB instance
*  Redis
*  Zookeeper
*  Load balancer to spread traffic across the Rancher instances
*  A host to run the websocket-proxy on. (Can be one of the Rancher Server nodes)


Documentation for building and scaling reliable Redis and Zookeeper installations are outside the scope of this document. As far as Rancher is concerned though, Redis and Zookeeper do not need to persist the data used by Rancher. If either ZooKeeper or Redis go down, Rancher will also go down, but the data in those system does not need to be present to recover. 

For MySQL, you can run your own or use MySQL provided by a cloud provider. We have used Google Cloud SQL and AWS RDS MySQL. 

Load balancing configuration can be handled in a number of ways. In our example configuration, servers are used in a round-robin configuration. The most basic health check that could be used is hitting the `/ping` url. It does not require authentication to receive the `pong` response.

The websocket-proxy provides a single target for the Rancher agent nodes to call into. It is currently a single container, but work is going on to add HA to this service. 


### Configuration

When launching rancher server, the following environment variables will need to be set:

* Websocket proxy settings:
  * CATTLE_HOST_API_PROXY_MODE: "ha"
  * CATTLE_HOST_API_PROXY_HOST: "<host_IP:port>" //This will need to be accessible from your browser AND to ALL compute nodes

   > **Note:** The IP that you configure for the websocket proxy needs be accessible from your browser and from the hosts. The hosts make outbound connections to it and browsers connect directly to it as well. `CATTLE_HOST_API_PROXY_HOST` for rancher/server would need to have the public IP of the server running the websocket proxy and the websocket proxy's -listen-address=<ip:port> param would need to be `0.0.0.0:<port>`.

* Database:
  * CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_HOST: `hostname or IP of MySQL instance`
  * CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_PORT: `3306`
  * CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_NAME: `Name of Database`
  * CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_USERNAME: `Username`
  * CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_PASSWORD: `Password`
* Zookeeper:    
  * CATTLE_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECTION_STRING: `comma separated list of zookeeper IPs ie. 10.0.1.2,10.0.1.3 will try connecting to 2181. Add :<port> for non-standard ports `
* Redis:
  * CATTLE_REDIS_HOSTS: `comma separated list of host:port server ips. ie 10.0.1.3:6379,10.0.1.4:6379`
  * CATTLE_REDIS_PASSWORD: `optional Redis password`

### Steps

1. Each server must have the basic [system requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/installing-rancher/installing-server/) needed to run Rancher
2. Verify all servers can talk to your Redis installation
3. Verify all servers can talk to your ZooKeeper installation
4. Setup your MySQL database: You will need to create a database and user before starting Rancher server.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cattle COLLATE = 'utf8_general_ci' CHARACTER SET = 'utf8';
    GRANT ALL ON cattle.* TO 'cattle'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'cattle';
    GRANT ALL ON cattle.* TO 'cattle'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'cattle'; 
    ```

5. Launch your rancher server instances with this command:
      
      ```bash
      sudo docker run -d --restart=always -p 8080:8080 \
        -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_HOST=<hostname or IP of MySQL instance> \
        -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_PORT=<port> \
        -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_NAME=<Name of Database> \
        -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_USERNAME=<Username> \
        -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_PASSWORD=<Password> \
        -e DEFAULT_CATTLE_MACHINE_EXECUTE=false \
        -e CATTLE_HOST_API_PROXY_MODE="ha" \
        -e CATTLE_HOST_API_PROXY_HOST="<host:port>" //This will need to be accessible from your browser AND to ALL compute nodes. It also cannot be the same address:port as rancher server \
        -e CATTLE_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECTION_STRING=<comma separated list of zookeeper IPs ie. 10.0.1.2,10.0.1.3> \
        -e CATTLE_REDIS_HOSTS=<comma separated list of host:port server ips. ie 10.0.1.3:6379,10.0.1.4:6379> \
        -e CATTLE_REDIS_PASSWORD=<optional Redis password> \
        rancher/server
      ```  
       > **Note:** In order to start websocket-proxy, Rancher server needs to be up and running. Therefore, Rancher server needs to be started with the `CATTLE_HOST_API_PROXY_MODE` and `CATTLE_HOST_API_PROXY_HOST` variables to be able to use websocket-proxy.
      
6. Point your load balancer at the server targets
7. Go to new installation ip: `http://<LB ip>:<port>`
8. Bring up the websocket-proxy:
   * download the Public Key to verify host tokens:
     * `curl -X GET -O http(s)://<rancher>/v1/scripts/api.crt`
   * Bring up websocket-proxy running on the host. (Do not use localhost)
     * `docker run -d -p <port>:<port> -v $(pwd)/api.crt:/api.crt rancher/server websocket-proxy -jwt-public-key-file=/api.crt -listen-address=0.0.0.0:<port>` 
9. Bring up `go-machine-service`
   * Create a service account and API keys:
      * Visit `http(s)://<rancher_server/v1/accounts` in a web browser.
      * Click `+Create` button.
          - kind: service
          - name: RemoteMachineService
          - uuid: RemoteMachineService
      * Click `Show Request` then `Send Request`
      * Click `Follow Self Link`
      * In the body there is a links section with a credentials link, click it.
      * Click `+Create`
      * Click `Show Request`
      * Click `Follow Self Link`
      * Make note of publicValue and secretValue.
   * Launch `go-machine-service` with this command:
      
      ```bash
      sudo docker run -d --restart=always \
        -e CATTLE_URL=http(s)://<Rancher URL>/v1 \
        -e CATTLE_ACCESS_KEY=<Service accounts publicValue> \
        -e CATTLE_SECRET_KEY=<Service accounts secretValue> \
        rancher/server go-machine-service
	  ```
