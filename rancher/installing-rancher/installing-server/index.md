## Installing Rancher Server
---
Rancher is deployed as a set of Docker containers. Running Rancher is a simple as launching two containers. One container as the management server and another container on a node as an agent. 

### Requirements

* Any modern Linux distribution that supports Docker 1.8+. [RancherOS](http://docs.rancher.com/os/), Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS 7 are more heavily tested. 
* 1GB RAM 
* MySQL server should have a max_connections setting > 150

### Launching Rancher Server 

On your Linux machine with Docker installed, the command to start Rancher is simple.

```bash
sudo docker run -d --restart=always -p 8080:8080 rancher/server
```

#### Rancher UI

The UI and API will be available on the exposed port `8080`. After the docker image is downloaded, it will take a minute or two before Rancher has successfully started. The IP of the machine will need to be public and accessible from the internet in order for Rancher to work.

You can access the UI by going to the following URL: `http://server_ip:8080`. The `server_ip` is the public IP address of the host that is running Rancher server.

`http://server_ip:8080`

Once the UI is up and running, you can start [adding hosts]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/hosts/). After the hosts are setup, you can start adding [services]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/applications/stacks/adding-services/).

### Enabling LDAP Capabilities for TLS

In order to enable LDAP for Rancher server with TLS, the Rancher server container will need need to be started with the  certificate passed to the server. On your Linux machine with Docker installed, place the certificate in `/some/dir`. 

Start Rancher by bind mount the volume that has the certificate. 

```bash
sudo docker run -d --restart=always -p 8080:8080 -v /some/dir/cert.crt:/ca.crt rancher/server
```

You can check that the `ca.crt` was passed to Rancher server container successfully by checking the logs of the rancher server container.

```bash
$ docker logs <server_container_id>
```

In the beginning of the logs, you should see confirmation that `ldap.crt` was added correctly.

```bash
DEFAULT_CATTLE_RANCHER_COMPOSE_WINDOWS_URL=https://releases.rancher.com/compose/beta/latest/rancher-compose-windows-386.zip
Adding ca.crt to Certs.
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs... 1 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d....
done.
done.
[BOOTSTRAP] Starting Cattle
```

### Bind Mount MySQL Volume

If you would like to persist the database inside your container to a volume on your host, you can launch Rancher server by bind mounting the MySQL volume.

```bash
$ sudo docker run -d -v <host_vol>:/var/lib/mysql --restart=always -p 8080:8080 rancher/server
```

With this command, the database will persist on the host.

### Using an external Database

If you require using an external database to run Rancher server, please follow these instructions to connect Rancher server to the database. Your database will already need to be created, but does not need any schemas created. Rancher will automatically create all the schemas related to Rancher.

The following environment variables will need to be passed within the `docker run` command in order to decouple the server from the DB. 

* CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_HOST: `hostname or IP of MySQL instance`
* CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_PORT: `3306`
* CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_NAME: `Name of Database`
* CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_USERNAME: `Username`
* CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_PASSWORD: `Password`


> **Note:** The name and user of the database must already exist in order for Rancher to be able to create the database schema. Rancher will not create the database. 

Here is the SQL command to create a database and users.

 ```sql
 CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cattle COLLATE = 'utf8_general_ci' CHARACTER SET = 'utf8';
 GRANT ALL ON cattle.* TO 'cattle'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'cattle';
 GRANT ALL ON cattle.* TO 'cattle'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'cattle';
 ```

After the database and user is created, you can run the command to launch rancher server.

```bash
sudo docker run -d --restart=always -p 8080:8080 \
    -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_HOST=<hostname or IP of MySQL instance> \
    -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_PORT=<port> \
    -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_MYSQL_NAME=<Name of Database> \
    -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_USERNAME=<Username> \
    -e CATTLE_DB_CATTLE_PASSWORD=<Password> \
    rancher/server
```

### Launching Rancher Server behind a HTTP proxy

In order to set up a HTTP proxy, you'll need to edit the Docker daemon to point to the proxy. Before attempting to start Rancher server, you'll need to edit the `/etc/default/docker` file to point to your proxy and restart Docker.

```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/default/docker
```

Within the file, edit the `#export http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:3128/"` to have it point to your proxy. Save your changes and then restart docker. Restarting Docker is different on every OS. 

> **Note:** If running Docker with systemd, please follow Docker's [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/articles/systemd/#http-proxy) on how to configure the HTTP proxy. 

After you've configured the proxy in your Docker daemon, just run your Rancher server command.

In order to add hosts to Rancher behind a proxy, please read about [adding custom hosts behind a proxy]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/hosts/custom/#hosts-behind-a-proxy).
