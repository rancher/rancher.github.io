## Rancher-Compose Labels 
---

Labels are used to help Rancher start up services and leverage the features of Rancher. This index of labels are used to help users create services using `rancher-compose`. 

Key | Value |Description
----|-----|---
`io.rancher.sidekicks` | Service Names  | Used to define what services are [sidekicks]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-compose/#sidekicks)
`io.rancher.loadbalancer.target.SERVICE_NAME` | `REQUEST_HOST:SOURCE_PORT/REQUEST_PATH=TARGET_PORT` |Used to determine [L7 Load Balancing]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-compose/rancher-services/#advanced-load-balancing-(l7))
`io.rancher.container.dns`| `true` | Service is able to use Rancher DNS based service discovery and network will be the host network.
`io.rancher.container.hostname_override` | `container_name` | Used to set the hostname of the container to the name of the container (e.g. StackName_ServiceName_CreateIndex)
`io.rancher.container.start_once` |`true` | Used to run a container once and have it remain in stopped state while the service remains in `active` state
`io.rancher.container.pull_image` | `always` | Used to always pull a new image before deploying container. 
`io.rancher.container.requested_ip` | An IP from the 10.42.0.0/16 address space | Allows you to pick a specific IP for a container. Note: If the IP is not available on any host, container will start with a random IP.
`io.rancher.service.selector.container` |  [_Selector Label_ Values]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/labels/#selector-labels) | Used on a service so that  standalone containers can be selected to join the service DNS. Note: As standalone containers, none of the service actions will affect the standalone container (i.e. deactivate/delete/edit service, healthcheck, etc). 
`io.rancher.service.selector.link` | [_Selector Label_ Values]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/labels/#selector-labels) | Used on a service to allow  services to be linked to the service based on service labels. Example: Service1 has a label `io.rancher.service.selector.link: foo=bar`. Any services that are added to Rancher that have a `foo=bar` label will automatically be linked to Service1. 
`io.rancher.scheduler.global` | `true` | Used to set [global services]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-compose/scheduling/#global-service)
`io.rancher.scheduler.affinity:host_label` | Key Value Pair of Host Label| Used to schedule containers on hosts based on [host label]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-compose/scheduling/#finding-hosts-with-host-labels) 
`io.rancher.scheduler.affinity:container_label` | Key Value Pair of Any Container Label | Used to schedule containers on hosts based on [container label or service name]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-compose/scheduling/#finding-hosts-with-container-labels) 
`io.rancher.scheduler.affinity:container` | Name of Container | Used to schedule containers on hosts based on [container name]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-compose/scheduling/#finding-hosts-with-container-names)

> **Note:** For the labels prefixed with `io.rancher.scheduler.affinity`, there are slight variations based on your how want to match (i.e. equal or not equal, hard or soft rules). More details can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-compose/scheduling/#table-of-scheduling-labels).

### Selector Labels

Using a _selector label_ (i.e. `io.rancher.service.selector.link`, `io.rancher.service.selector.container`), Rancher can identify services/containers by their labels and have them automatically linked to the service. _Selector labels_ are evaluated in two scenarios. Scenario 1 is when a _selector label_ is added to a service. In Scenario 1, all existing labels are evaluated to see if they match the _selector label_. Scenario 2 is when a service already has a _selector label_. In Scenario 2, any new services/containers added to Rancher is checked to see if it qualifies to be linked. A _selector label_ can be made of multiple requirements, which are comma separated. If there are multiple requirements, all requirements must be satisfied so the comma separator acts as an **AND** logical operator. 

```
# One of the container labels must have a key equal to `foo1` and value equal to `bar1`
foo1 = bar1
# One of the container labels must have a key equal to `foo2` with a value not equal to `bar2` 
foo2 != bar2
# One of the container labels must have a key equal to `foo3`, value of the label does not matter
foo3
# One of the container labels must have a key equal to `foo4` and value equal to `bar1` OR `bar2`
foo4 in (bar1, bar2)
# One of the container labels must have a key equal to `foo5` and value other than `bar3` OR `bar4`
foo5 notin (bar3, bar4)
```

> **Note:** If there is a label with a value that contains a comma in it, the selector will not be able to match with the label as the _selector label_ can match on any key with no associated value. Example: A label of `io.rancher.service.selector.link: foo=bar1,bar2` would translate to any service that have one label must be key equals to `foo` and value equal to `bar1` **AND** another label with key equal to `bar2`. It would NOT pick up a service that has a label with key equal to `foo` and value equal to `bar1,bar2`. 

#### Example of a comma separated list

```
service1: 
  labels:
    # Selector label added to pick up other services
    io.rancher.service.selector.link: hello != world, hello1 in (world1, world2), foo = bar
```

In this example, the service that would be linked to `service1` would need to satisfy all of the following conditions:

* A label with key equal to `hello` and value NOT equal to `world`
* A label with key equal to `hello1` can have either value equal to `world1` or `world2`
* A label with key equal to `foo` and value equal to `bar`


With the example below, `service2` would automatically link to `service1` when deployed.

```
service2:
   labels:
      hello: test
      hello1: world2
      foo: bar
```

## System Labels

Besides labels that can be used by `rancher-compose`, there are a series of system labels that Rancher creates when starting services.

Key | Description
----|---
`io.rancher.stack.name`/`io.rancher.project.name` | Used to define the stack name of service
`io.rancher.stack_service.name`/`io.rancher.project_service.name`|Determines the name of the stack 
`io.rancher.service.deployment.unit` |  Used to define the deployments for sidekicked services.
`io.rancher.service.launch.config` |   Used to define configurations for side kicked services.
`io.rancher.service.requested.host.id` |  Used by the scheduler to know which host it was scheduled on


## Native Docker Labels

`io.rancher.container.network` | `true`|  Add this label to a `docker run` command to add Rancher networking to the container
