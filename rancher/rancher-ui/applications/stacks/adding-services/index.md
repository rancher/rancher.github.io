## Adding Services
---

With Rancher, you can add multiple services in a stack to make an application. With this guide, we'll assume you've already created a [stack]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/applications/stacks/), set up your [hosts]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/hosts/), and are ready to build your application. 

We'll walk through how to create a Wordpress application linked to a MySQL database. Inside your stack, you add a service by clicking the **Add Service** button. Alternatively, if you are viewing the stacks at the stack level, the same **Add Service** button is visible for each specific stack. 

You will need to provide a **Name** and if desired, **Description** of the service. In the **Scale** section, you can use the slider for the specific number of containers you want launched for a service. Alternatively, you can select **Always run one instance of this container on every host**. With this option, your service will scale for any additional hosts that are added to your [environment]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/configuration/environments/). If you have scheduling rules in the **Advanced Options** -> **Scheduling**, Rancher will only start containers on the hosts that meet the host labels rules. If you add a host to your environment that doesn't meet the scheduling rules, a container will not be started on the host.

Provide the **Image** to use. You can use any image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) as well as any [registries]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/configuration/registries) that have been added to Rancher. The syntax for image name would match any `docker run` commands. 

Syntax of image names. By default, we pull from the docker registry. If no tag is specified, we will pull the latest tag. 

`[registry-name]/[namespace]/[imagename]:[version]`

We'll start by creating our MySQL database service with only 1 container.

### Options

Just like adding individual [containers]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/containers/), any options that `docker run` supports, Rancher also supports! Port mapping and service links are shown on the main page, but other options are within the **Advanced Options** section. 

#### Port Mapping

When we are mapping ports, we are creating the ability to access the container through the host IP. In the **Port Map** section, you will define the public ports that will be used to connect to the container. You  also define the port will be exposed on the container. When mapping ports for a container to a host, Rancher will check to see if there are any port conflicts before launching the container.

When using port mapping, if the scale of your service is more than the number of hosts with available port(s), your service will become stuck in an activating state. The service will continue to try and if a host/port(s) becomes available, the service will continue to launch containers. 

> **Note:** When ports are exposed in Rancher, it will not show up in `docker ps` as Rancher manages the iptable rules to make the ports fully dynamic. 

#### Linking Services 

If other services have already been created, you can add links to the service. Linking services will link all containers in a service to all containers in another service. Linking services acts like the `--link` functionality in a `docker run` command.

#### Environment Variables 

When expanding the **Advanced Options**, you have the ability to add the environment variables, which is located in the **Command** tab. For the MySQL service, we'll need to add the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` as an environment variable and provide the key and value. This environment variable requirement follows the required parameters for launching a `mysql` image in DockerHub.

### Rancher Options

Besides providing all the options that `docker run` support, Rancher provides additional concepts available in the UI.

#### Health Checks

Rancher implements a distributed health monitoring system by running an HAProxy instance on every host for the sole purpose of providing health checks to containers.  When health checks are enabled either on an individual container or a service,  each container is then monitored by up to three HAProxy instances running on different hosts. The container is considered healthy if at least one HAProxy instance reports a "passed" health check.

Rancherâ€™s approach handles network partitions and is more efficient than client-based health checks. By using HAProxy to perform health checks, Rancher enables users to specify the same health check policy for DNS service and for load balancers.

In the **Advanced Options** section, the **Health Check** tab allows you to check TCP connections or HTTP responses for services. 

#### Labels/Scheduling 

In the **Labels** tab, Rancher allows you to add any labels to containers in a service. Labels are very useful to be used when creating scheduling rules. In the **Scheduling** tab, you can use the [host labels]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/hosts/#host-labels), container/service labels, and container/service names to create where you want the containers of your service to be scheduled. 

More details about labels and scheduling can be read [here]({{{{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/scheduling/).

### Starting Services

After filling out the information for your service, click **Create**. Creating the service will not automatically start the service. Currently, any linked services that are dependent on environment variables will need to be started in the correct order. This means that you will need to start the database before any services that are linked to the database. <!--This allows you to create multiple services and when your application is ready, you can start all services at once!-->

Now that we've launched our database, we'll add the Wordpress service to our stack. This time, we'll launch 3 containers in our service using the Wordpress image. We will not expose any ports in our Wordpress service as we will want to load balance this application. Since we've already created the database service, we'll pick the database service in the **Service Links** and select the name _mysql_. Just like Docker, Rancher will set up the environment variables in the WordPress image when linking two containers together, by naming the database as _mysql_.

Click on **Create** and our Wordpress app is ready to be started! In our wordpress app, it shows us that the database service is linked. 

<!-- ### Starting Services

There are several ways to start services. You can immediately start it after creating the service by clicking on the **Start** link within the service or even using the **Start** option in the service's dropdown menu. You can also wait until after you have created all your services and start them all at once using the **Start Services** in the dropdown menu of the Stack. -->

### Load Balancing Services

At this point, it would make sense to load balance our Wordpress service. Let's move on to how to [add a load balancer]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/applications/stacks/adding-balancers/) into our stack.
