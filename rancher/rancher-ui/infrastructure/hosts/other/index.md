## Adding Hosts from Other Cloud Providers
---

Rancher supports provisioning from other cloud providuers using `docker-machine`. The other cloud providers have a generic UI, which provides all the options in `docker-machine`, and we only require the necessary parameters.

### Launching Other Host(s) 

Select the **Other** icon in the **Add Host** page. 

1. Select the number of hosts you want to launch using the slider.
2. Provide a **Name** and if desired, **Description** for the host.
3. Select the type of **Driver** that you'd like to use. 
4. Based on your **Driver**, the **Driver Options** section will be populated according to the available options in `docker-machine`. 
5. (Optional) Add **[labels]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/hosts/#labels)** to hosts to help organize your hosts and to [schedule services/load balancers]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/scheduling/).
6. When complete, click **Create**. 

Once you click on create, Rancher will create start a VM in your selected **Driver** using `docker-machine` and launch the _rancher-agent_ container in the VM. In a couple of minutes, the host will be active and available for [services]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/applications/stacks/adding-services/).
