## Host Registration
---
Before launching any hosts, you will be asked to complete the host registration. This registration sets up how your Rancher server is going to connect with your hosts. If you have already set up [access control]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/configuration/access-control), you will not be prompted to set host registration as Rancher assumes that your URL will be accessible.

The setup determines the base URL your hosts will use to connect to the Rancher API. By default, we select the base URL you used to access the UI.  If you choose to change the address, please make sure to specify the port that should be used to connect to the Rancher API. If you are configuring Rancher with SSL, be sure to change the protocol to `https`. This registration set up determines what the command will be for [adding custom hosts]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/hosts/custom/).

If [access control]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/configuration/access-control/) is turned on for Rancher, only the **admin** will be able to change the host registration. By default, the first **admin** is the first user to authenticate with Rancher when access control was configured. If access-control is still not configured, any users to the site can update the host registration. This option can be updated in the **Admin** -> **Host Registation** tab.
